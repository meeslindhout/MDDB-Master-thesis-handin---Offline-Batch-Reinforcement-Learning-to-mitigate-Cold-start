# Readme

This repository contains all the code to run the experiments of the Master Thesis "Empirical analysis of Reinforcement Learning to alleviate
the new user problem in e-commerce Session Based Recommender Systems." by Mees Lindhout.

instructions:
- Install the requirements.txt (always create a new environment to avoid conflicts with other packages!)
- Download pretrained agents from [here](https://icthva-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mees_lindhout_hva_nl/EjZqaU7dDDhNlYVhK2PJT18BKCpxamzrmgyMT9tIHuk-kQ?e=JgkLKM) and create a folder called `trained agents` in the root of the repository. Place the downloaded agents in this folder.
- Run the various experiments and evaluations in the jupyter notebooks


Some code is based on the session-rec github repository. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/rn5l/session-rec). Each .py file contains a reference to the original code if it was used.
